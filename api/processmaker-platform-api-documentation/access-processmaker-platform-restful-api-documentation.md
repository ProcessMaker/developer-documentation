# Access ProcessMaker Platform RESTful API Documentation

## Overview

Despite the ProcessMaker Platform user interface, the platform operates entirely from a RESTful API. Administrators and developers may want to access our API documentation to understand how to use endpoints or to consider how to extend ProcessMaker Platform functionality for their own use cases.

Test API endpoints to see how they work. For example, view the [curl](https://github.com/curl/curl) command or URL to run our API endpoint, the possible responses and returned schema structure, and other technical information how to use that API endpoint.

You must have the following to test our API endpoints from the API documentation. You must know the base URL to your ProcessMaker Platform instance. Example: `https://MyOrganization.processmaker.net/`.

## Test API Endpoints from the API Documentation

Follow these steps to test our RESTful API endpoints from the API documentation:

1. Open a new Web browser tab or window.
2. Append `api/documentation` to the end of your ProcessMaker Platform instance's base URL. Example: `https://MyOrganization.processmaker.net/api/documentation`. The API documentation displays.
3. Click the **Expand operation** icon<img src="broken-reference" alt="" data-size="line">for the ProcessMaker Platform API endpoint you want to test. Technical information about that API endpoint displays.
4. Click the **Try it out** button, and then enter parameters documented for that API endpoint into their appropriate fields.
5. Click **Execute**.

## Make API Calls with the Data Connector

You may use a Data Connector to make requests (calls) with our API associated with your ProcessMaker Platform instance. See [Manage Data Connectors](broken-reference).
